  /*
  A multiway tree is composed of a root element and a (possibly empty) set of successors which are multiway trees
  themselves. A multiway tree is never empty. The set of successor trees is sometimes called a forest.

  The code to represent these is somewhat simpler than the code for binary trees, partly because we don't separate
  classes for nodes and terminators, and partly because we don't need the restriction that the value type be ordered.

        case class MTree[+T](value: T, children: List[MTree[T]]) {
          def this(value: T) = this(value, List())
          override def toString = "M(" + value.toString + " {" + children.map(_.toString).mkString(",") + "})"
        }

        object MTree {
          def apply[T](value: T) = new MTree(value, List())
          def apply[T](value: T, children: List[MTree[T]]) = new MTree(value, children)
        }

  The example tree is, thus:

       MTree('a', List(MTree('f', List(MTree('g'))), MTree('c'), MTree('b', List(MTree('d'), MTree('e')))))

  previous level. By this rule, the tree in the figure opposite is represented as:

  """P73 Lisp-like tree representation

  There is a particular notation for multiway trees in Lisp. Lisp is a prominent functional programming language.
  In Lisp almost everything is a list. Our example tree would be represented in Lisp as (a (f g) c (b d e)). The
  following pictures give some more examples.

  Note that in the "lispy" notation a node with successors (children) in the tree is always the first element in a
  list, followed by its children. The "lispy" representation of a multiway tree is a sequence of atoms and parentheses
  '(' and ')', with the atoms separated by spaces. We can represent this syntax as a Scala String. Write a method
  lispyTree which constructs a "lispy string" from an MTree

  As a second, even more interesting, exercise try to write a method that takes a "lispy" string and turns it into a
  multiway tree.

  [Note: Much of this problem is taken from the wording of the same problem in the Prolog set. This is certainly one
   way of looking at Lisp notation, but it's not how the language actually represents that syntax internally. I can
   elaborate more on this, if requested""" >> {
