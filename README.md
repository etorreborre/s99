S-99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems
====

My implementation of the [99 Scala problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/), accompanied by [specs2](http://specs2.org) specifications (using [these](https://github.com/etorreborre/s99) as a start) and ready to run with [sbt](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/).

The coverage of the specs is continuously being increased as I am solving the problems, in order for me to test all relevant corner cases (at least the ones I can remember). People who want to solve these problems and want a fresh code base with tests can fork the branch `specs-only`.
